# Git Definitions - Fred Version

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
It's  usually a backup of a code where we can make changes, experient with, review and if necessary revert to original code. We've been using Git as our version control program.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
Its a copy of code where you will work on and make changes or add new features. We use to add new features to the code that can or can not be merged to the master.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
Commit is when you save the new feature or changes added to the code with a commit message so you can relate to that later. A good commit message states effectively what have been added or changed in that commit.

* What is a merge conflict? Its a conflict that occurs when the same line of a code has two changes in a file to be merged. Or when you try to edit a file that has been deleted.
