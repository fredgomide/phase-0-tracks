  <h1>Bengal, the leopard-like cat</h1>
    <p>The Bengal is a domestic cat breed developed to look like exotic jungle cats such as leopards, ocelots, margays and clouded leopards.</p>
      <strong>The name "Bengal cat" was derived from the taxonomic name of the Asian leopard cat (P. b. bengalensis).
        <em>They have a "wild" appearance with large spots/rosettes/arrowheads, and a light/white belly, and a body structure reminiscent of the ALC.</em>
    Once separated by at least four generations from the original ALC and domestic cat crossing, the breed possesses a
        <em>gentle domestic cat temperament</em>.</strong>
